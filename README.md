## Hi there 👋

I’m Mirelle, a Computer Engineering student from Minas Gerais, Brazil. I enjoy solving problems through code while keeping solutions clean and simple.

My main interests lie in **web development** and **artificial intelligence**.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on both creative and analytical projects.

On the AI and computational side:

- [**Lung Cancer Classification**](github.com/mirellesv/lung-cancer-histopathology-classification) – Deep learning model using CNN and ResNet-50 for histopathological image classification.
- [**Chest X-Ray Image Analysis**](https://github.com/mirellesv/image-processing-segmentation-analysis) – Image enhancement and lung segmentation using digital image processing techniques.
- [**Contact Process Simulation**](https://github.com/mirellesv/contact-process-simulation) – Stochastic modeling and phase transition analysis in complex networks (Undergraduate thesis project).

On the web side, I built projects like:

- [**Cordel Moderno**](https://github.com/mirellesv/cordel-parallax-webpage) – A responsive webpage inspired by Brazilian literature and visual storytelling.
- [**Android Landing Page**](https://github.com/mirellesv/android-history-landing-page) – A layout-focused web project exploring structure, responsiveness, and clean styling.

### What I’m currently working on

- Improving my JavaScript fundamentals for modern web development  
- Deepening my knowledge in Python for AI  
- Studying mathematical foundations behind machine learning  

### Outside of code

- I enjoy learning new languages 🌍
- I’m always watching series and movies 🎬 
- And I love reading 📚
